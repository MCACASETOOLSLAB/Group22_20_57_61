Dining Philoshopher Problem

Please visit "FINAL SOLUTION/index.html" for take a look what we had done.

Here we have tried to explain the process synchronization problem with the help of GUI based solution of Dining Philoshopher Problem.
We have given solution in two ways : 
1. C code implementation
2. GUI based solution using HTML - 
                            In this we have included a "Resource Hierarchy Solution" and "Conductor Solution(SEMAPHORE)".

Four Folders are there : 

1. DINING PHILOSHOPHERS - It contains only problem statement. (Iniatialization of our work)
2. GUI - Resource Hierarchy Solution included - Next version of DINING PHILOSHOPHERS folder, contains Rsource hierarchy solution.
3. GUI - with Conclusion of Resource Hierarchy Solution - Next version of above contains conclusion also.
4. FINAL SOLUTION - Finalized version contains both solution mentioned above.

THREE FILES are there :

1. Documentation.
2. C code Implementation.
3. Read Me file.

Please visit "FINAL SOLUTION/index.html" for take a look what we had done.
