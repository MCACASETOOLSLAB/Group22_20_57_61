Dining Philoshopher Problem

Here we have tried to explain the process synchronization problem with the help of GUI based solution of Dining Philoshopher Problem.
We have given solution in two ways : 
1. C code implementation
2. GUI based solution using HTML - In this we have included a "Resource Hierarchy Solution" with the conclusion, from which it is clear that for better implementation we have to include a "Conductor Solution(SEMAPHORE)".

We are working on Conductor Solution, which we will include in next version.
